# Missing features and TODOs

## Knife versions

### Slime Knife

- add texture (use iron knife as base)
- let the knife bounce on hard blocks for e.g. three times

### Roped Knife

- add two textures -> use iron knife as base -> one where rope is extended and one 
- pull hit entities towards the user (cancelable with crouch)
- stick into wooden objects and interact like a graphing gun (without pulling)
- implement a rope renderer? (see lead item connection rendering)

### Netherite Knife

- add texture (use iron knife as base)
- set enemies on fire

## Add custom effects

- sleep effect
  - screen goes completely dark
  - use lay down animation from bed?
  - fade out UI elements?
  
all effect durations should add to already applied effect's duration

## Custom crafting station for coating

- also used for knife crafting?

## Balancing

- tweak damage values
