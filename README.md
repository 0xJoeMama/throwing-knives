# Features

The throwing knives mod for Minecraft allows players to craft and use throwable knives not only as a new weapon but, depending on the knife, also as a tool.
These knives can deal damage to mobs and interact differently with blocks, making them a useful tool for survival and combat.
The throwing knives mod adds a new level of excitement and strategy to gameplay, as players must carefully aim their throws and conserve the limited supply of throwable goods.

# Compatibility

In addition to the brand-new throwing knives made out of all vanilla metals, over 60 new Throwing Knives have been created to support your material of choice! The following mods are supported but not required.</p>

- Mythic Metals
- Adabranium
- Dragon Loot
